# Fake News Detection using Python & Machine Learning
This project is aimed at detecting fake news articles using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
<br>
#üîç Project Overview
The goal is to build a binary classifier that can accurately distinguish between real and fake news based on the article text. This is achieved using tools from the Python ecosystem including scikit-learn, pandas, and joblib.<br>
